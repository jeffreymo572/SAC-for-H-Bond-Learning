# Running Octree
To run the octree, go to `/Octree/` and run `make octree`. Then run `python Octree.py` to run the current version of the Octree.

# TODOs
Current the entire Octree is wrapped but the individual functions are not. Specifically, the process of removing atoms and inserting atoms is not defined in the `cython` code.
